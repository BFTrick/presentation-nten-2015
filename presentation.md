# The Story of Steve and John

# Steve

^ So you're a business owner and you hear you need a website so that people can find you. And everyone keeps saying how "easy" it is.

^ There's a problem though. And that's that...

---

# You're an Expert at *Your* Business
## Not Websites

^ Do you need a responsive site? Do you need SEO optimization? Do you need a newsletter? How many pages do you need? Don't you want an app? What's the difference between a responsive site and an app anyway?

^ With a lot of companies you're basically shooting in the dark. And this is what happens...

# The Saga Isn't Over

^ Now we have website maintenance. Do you pay an agency $500 a month to maintain your site? Or do you pay them nothing and assume the responsibility yourself?

^ When I worked at an agency many people opted for updating the website themselves and you know how often things got updated? Approximately *never*. We're *ALL* busy people. With a million things we'd rather be doing for our business.

# A Book Recommendation

![right](assets/images/good-to-great.jpg)

^ In this book the author, Jim Collins, focuses on companies that were "good" for at least 15 years and then became "great" for at least 15 years after that. Good companies basically did as well as their competitors Great companies destroyed their competition.

^ He developed a lot of interesting theories doing this study. One of which is the hedgehog concept. Which is where you focus on ONE thing to the exclusion of all else. And by doing this one thing better than anyone else you'll become the leader.

^ The reason it's called the hedgehog concept is because no matter how clever, or fast, or pouncy, another animal is he won't be able to beat the hedgehog. No matter what comes at the hedgehog he knows what he's good at. He'll curl up into a ball of spikes until the threat goes away.

^ I realize this story has been going on a while. But I have a point.
