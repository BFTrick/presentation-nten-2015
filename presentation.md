# Escape Velocity

^ I used to play a lot of video games when I was back in middle school and high school. One of those games was called Escape Velocity. You got to fly around in this tincy little cargo ship. Deliver goods, and then after delivering goods for an hour or two you could upgrade to a bigger ship. You do more deliveries you get a bigger ship. You start exploring and delivering yet more goods and you start getting escort ships that help you carry more. By the end of the game I had a fleet of ships.

^ By the time I got a full escort full of guard ships and cargo ships something changed.

# Escape Velocity Override

^ It was the same sort of game with cargo ships and getting more impressive ships but... the problem is that you had to start over. Even if you already had an impressive fleet in the last game you start this game with the tinciest tiny little cargo ship.

# Backwards Compatibility

^ In the tech world we call this backwards compatibility. And going from EV1 -> EV2 wasn't backwards compatible.

^ I basically didn't play EV2 because I had already beaten EV1. Why would I want to redo 80 hours of game play?

^ And I ask the same question for all of you - why would you want to redo 80 hours of work? If you build a custom website don't you want it to last? Who wants to pay a developer two weeks of salary just to keep things up to date?

^ This is both WordPress' greatest strength and greatest weakness. Other projects like Drupal move lightning fast added all sorts of features but things aren't backwards compatible. That means that sometimes you *have* to install the newest version for security reasons and then you have to update your site.
